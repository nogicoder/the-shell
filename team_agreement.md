*Features to Implement*
+ globbing ★✩✩✩ (Handling wildcards)
+ path expansions (tilde expansions, parameter expansions)★✩✩✩ (Use of ~ and $)
+ pipes & the redirections >, <, >> and << ★★★✩ (| and I/O using > < >> <<)

  file and reaccess to list history or recall with !)
+ dynamic command completion ★★✩✩ (use tab to finish the command/ filename)
